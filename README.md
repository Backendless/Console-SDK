# Backendless Console SDK for Node.js and browser   

Alongside with the app development APIs, Backendless Service Platform also provides an extremely rich set of administrative and management functions for a developer. 

Every single feature is available either in Backendless console or via specialized REST API. 

Whether it is performing a data import/export, setting up database schema or retrieving application's analytics - all of these can be done with a REST call. 

These APIs are available for any customer who upgrades to Backendless Plus or the Cloud Enterprise plans.

**Backendless Console SDK** gives you access to the Backendless Console Management API from your JavaScript app
